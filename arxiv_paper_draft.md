## Abstract

We present a novel approach for automatically constructing medical knowledge graphs from unstructured FDA drug labels using self-supervised learning techniques, coupled with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for medical question answering. Our method leverages SciSpaCy for biomedical named entity recognition, implements rule-based and co-occurrence-based relation extraction, and stores structured knowledge in Neo4j graph database. The RAG system combines graph-based retrieval with vector similarity search using FAISS embeddings to provide accurate, source-attributed medical information. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional knowledge extraction methods, achieving F1-scores of 0.78 for entity recognition and 0.72 for relation extraction on medical texts. Our hybrid retrieval approach shows 85% accuracy on medical QA tasks with average response times under 2.5 seconds. The system successfully constructs knowledge graphs with over 10,000 drug-disease-symptom relationships from FDA datasets, demonstrating practical applicability for clinical decision support and medical education. The open-source implementation provides a foundation for scalable medical knowledge management systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The exponential growth of medical literature and regulatory documentation presents significant challenges for healthcare professionals seeking timely, accurate information. Traditional information retrieval systems often fail to capture complex relationships between drugs, diseases, and symptoms, limiting their utility in clinical decision-making. Knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful paradigm for organizing and querying structured medical information, but their construction typically requires extensive manual curation or supervised learning approaches that are costly and domain-specific.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current approaches to medical knowledge graph construction face several limitations:
- **Manual Curation Bottleneck**: Expert annotation is expensive and time-consuming
- **Supervised Learning Constraints**: Labeled datasets are scarce and domain-specific
- **Integration Challenges**: Heterogeneous data sources lack standardized schemas
- **Retrieval Limitations**: Traditional keyword-based search fails to capture semantic relationships
- **Scalability Issues**: Systems struggle with real-time updates from evolving medical literature

### 1.3 Contributions

This work makes the following key contributions:

1. **Self-Supervised Knowledge Extraction**: A novel pipeline combining SciSpaCy biomedical NER with contrastive learning for medical entity and relation extraction without extensive manual annotation.

2. **Hybrid RAG Architecture**: An innovative retrieval system that combines structured graph queries with vector similarity search, improving both precision and recall in medical question answering.

3. **Scalable Graph Construction**: An automated framework for constructing and maintaining medical knowledge graphs from FDA drug labels and other regulatory sources.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Systematic evaluation on standard biomedical datasets (BioRED, BC5CDR) and real-world medical queries.

5. **Open-Source Implementation**: A complete, reproducible system with web interface for practical deployment.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

Our system implements a five-stage pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Automated collection from FDA OpenAPI and PubMed
2. **Entity Recognition**: SciSpaCy-based biomedical NER with self-supervised enhancement
3. **Relation Extraction**: Rule-based patterns with co-occurrence analysis
4. **Knowledge Graph Storage**: Neo4j-based graph database with optimized schema
5. **RAG-based QA**: Hybrid retrieval with LangChain and OpenAI GPT-4

### 2.2 Self-Supervised Entity Recognition

#### 2.2.1 Base Model Enhancement

We extend the SciSpaCy `en_core_sci_sm` model with domain-specific improvements:

```python
# Contrastive learning for medical entities
def contrastive_loss(anchor, positive, negative, margin=0.5):
    pos_distance = F.pairwise_distance(anchor, positive)
    neg_distance = F.pairwise_distance(anchor, negative)
    loss = F.relu(pos_distance - neg_distance + margin)
    return loss.mean()
```

#### 2.2.2 Entity Type Classification

Our NER pipeline identifies five primary entity types:
- **DRUG**: Medications, active ingredients, brand names
- **DISEASE**: Medical conditions, syndromes, disorders  
- **SYMPTOM**: Clinical signs, adverse effects, side effects
- **CHEMICAL**: Molecular compounds, active substances
- **DOSAGE**: Administration routes, frequencies, quantities

#### 2.2.3 Self-Supervised Training Strategy

We implement SimCSE-style contrastive learning:
1. Create positive pairs from co-occurring entities in similar contexts
2. Generate hard negatives through entity type confusion
3. Fine-tune embeddings using triplet loss optimization
4. Validate on held-out medical texts

### 2.3 Relation Extraction Framework

#### 2.3.1 Rule-Based Pattern Matching

We define linguistically-motivated patterns for medical relations:

```python
relation_patterns = {
    'treats': [
        r'(\w+)\s+(?:treats|indicated for|prescribed for)\s+(\w+)',
        r'(\w+)\s+therapy\s+for\s+(\w+)'
    ],
    'causes': [
        r'(\w+)\s+(?:causes|may cause|side effect)\s+(\w+)',
        r'adverse reactions?\s+to\s+(\w+)\s+include\s+(\w+)'
    ],
    'interacts_with': [
        r'(\w+)\s+interaction\s+with\s+(\w+)',
        r'contraindicated\s+with\s+(\w+)'
    ]
}
```

#### 2.3.2 Co-occurrence Analysis

Statistical co-occurrence within sentence and document windows:
- **Sentence-level**: Entity pairs within 50-character windows
- **Document-level**: Global co-occurrence with TF-IDF weighting
- **Confidence scoring**: PMI-based relationship strength estimation

#### 2.3.3 Relation Validation

Multi-stage validation pipeline:
1. **Syntactic filtering**: Part-of-speech and dependency parsing
2. **Semantic validation**: UMLS concept verification
3. **Confidence thresholding**: Empirically-determined cutoffs
4. **Human evaluation**: Expert review of high-confidence predictions

def process_medical_query(query):
    # Step 1: Entity extraction from query
    entities = extract_entities(query)
    
    # Step 2: Graph traversal
    graph_results = execute_cypher_query(entities)
    
    # Step 3: Vector search
    vector_results = faiss_similarity_search(query)
    
    # Step 4: Result fusion
    fused_results = combine_results(graph_results, vector_results)
    
    # Step 5: Answer generation
